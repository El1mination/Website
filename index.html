   <center><p><b><I><u> August 25, today was the first journal entry I ever did and it was pretty cool cause I got to push this to github! I already knew the github commands so it was pretty easy but I also got my own key from this specific website. I saved the key on a google doc so I won't have to type it out or anything.</u></I></center>
    <center><p><b><I><u> September 10 today! We learned how to use different things like marquee and underline as well as bold things and even add videos and images. I learned that the videos worked best as MP4 and images worked best as PNG. I guess this is because it is more common and esaier for the computer to process. </u></I></center>
     <center><p><b><I><u> September 25, Here is the video fo the cardboard thing we made, it was a robotic hand. The robotic hand was cool but kind of hard to make because we had to find a way to move the fingers'. The way we moved the fingers was by attaching them to strings so when we pulled on the string it created a chain effect and bent the joints of the finger aswell as the top.</u></I></center>

     <center><p><b><I><u> October 5 (Absent), I was absent on this day so I am making it up today, but here is the website update anyways. Also here is a video of the balloon popping we did a while ago, it was hard to make the prototype but when it worked it was very cool. The way we did it is by making a small car drive into the balloon and pop it, we sued strings and attached it to the box to help with the car. </u></I></center>

      <center><p><b><I><u> October 13, quarter is going to end so I am making finishing touches to my website and fixing some small things, I also learned some new ways of coding and making things look nicer, from now on I am going to space each different log out and make it look nicer without using too many different effects. </u></I></center>
      
      <center><p><b><I><u> October 20, Today we tested out the bottle rocket and it was very cool, our rocket wasn't the best but wasn't the worst, one problem that made it hard was that our bottle was smaller so the preassure used had to be 50 instead of 70 but it still worked niceley. We glued some fins to the sides of the rocket to make it fly in the air better,it worked pretty good but we should have put a cone at the top of the rocket so it would glide in the air better. </u></I></center>
      
      <center><p><b><I><u> October 26, today we tried to make a water filtration system using sand, tiny rocks, big rocks, and cotton. The layering worked best when you used cotton first to get all of the exteremly tiny bits of dirt out, then sand to filter the small ammounts of dirt, then used little rocks to filter the small chunks of dirt, and finally big rocks to filter out the big chunks of mulch and dirt. It was hard to create this system but the way me and Andres did it was by using two different bottles. The first bottle was to filter the bigger picese of dirt and then the second bottle was to filter all the micro pieces of dirt, it didn't work out the best but it somewhat worked. I think the problem was that we used too many layers so it was actually counter productive. </u></I></center>

     <center><p><b><I><u> November 2, We learned about how electricity works in Voltages, we use the greek letter Omega to tell the voltages. It's still confusing for me but I'm starting to understand it more, theres a minumum level of voltages that you use and a maximum because you don't want it to explode. We also learned about Breadboards and how they are used to power things like LED's. We also use transistors to limit the flow of the voltages so it's under our control. We use a tool called a multimeter to measure the ammount of voltages so it's easier to control. We are using tinkercad for our lab assignments and this was my first breadboard I made to power an LED. I used a multimeter, a transistor, an LED, and a battery to power this LED. Here is the picture of it. The second lab was much more challenging though, It was hard to figure it out without clear instructions. </u></I></center>

     <center><p><b><I><u> November 15, we went through lab 3 and 4 and there were some challenges along the way but it ended up working in the end. We managed to make the LED blink by using external code connected to the Arduino computer that made the LED blink. The Hardest part about lab 3 was figuring out how to use a single transistor to power the LED and make it work. The lab 4 was much easire to execute as the code was easier to implement and the hardware side of it was relatively easy. It as easy because we learned how to do it better after doing lab 3.  </u></I></center>
     <center><p><b><I><u> December 2, I read the Business slides from Andres and Aaron, it was about a ski invention we made that revolutionalizes ski's. It is a foldable ski that is easy to carry around, and it very sturdy, strong, and very durrable. It is very easy to move around and is nice. It has points in the middle of the skis that let's you retract and fold it. It is made with stronger material and will be much more useful than normal skis. </u></I></center>
