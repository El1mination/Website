   <center><p><b><I><u> August 25, today was the first journal entry I ever did and it was pretty cool cause I got to push this to github!</u></I></center>
    <center><p><b><I><u> September 10 today! We learned how to use different things like marquee and underline as well as bold things and even add videos and images. I learned that the videos worked best as MP4 and PNG </u></I></center>
     <center><p><b><I><u> September 25, its 2 weeks later from last time which is pretty cool. Here is the video fo the cardboard thing we made, it was a robotic hand. The robotic hand was cool but kind of hard to make because we had to find a way to move the fingers.</u></I></center>
