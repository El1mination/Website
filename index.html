   <center><p><b><I><u> August 25, today was the first journal entry I ever did and it was pretty cool cause I got to push this to github! I already knew the github commands so it was pretty easy but I also got my own key from this specific website. I saved the key on a google doc so I won't have to type it out or anything.</u></I></center>
    <center><p><b><I><u> September 10 today! We learned how to use different things like marquee and underline as well as bold things and even add videos and images. I learned that the videos worked best as MP4 and images worked best as PNG. I guess this is because it is more common and esaier for the computer to process. </u></I></center>
     <center><p><b><I><u> September 25, Here is the video fo the cardboard thing we made, it was a robotic hand. The robotic hand was cool but kind of hard to make because we had to find a way to move the fingers'. The way we moved the fingers was by attaching them to strings so when we pulled on the string it created a chain effect and bent the joints of the finger aswell as the top.</u></I></center>

     <center><p><b><I><u> October 5 (Absent), I was absent on this day so I am making it up today, but here is the website update anyways. Also here is a video of the balloon popping we did a while ago, it was hard to make the prototype but when it worked it was very cool. The way we did it is by making a small car drive into the balloon and pop it, we sued strings and attached it to the box to help with the car. </u></I></center>

      <center><p><b><I><u> October 13, quarter is going to end so I am making finishing touches to my website and fixing some small things, I also learned some new ways of coding and making things look nicer, from now on I am going to space each different log out and make it look nicer without using too many different effects. </u></I></center>
      
      <center><p><b><I><u> October 20, Today we tested out the bottle rocket and it was very cool, our rocket wasn't the best but wasn't the worst, one problem that made it hard was that our bottle was smaller so the preassure used had to be 50 instead of 70 but it still worked niceley. We glued some fins to the sides of the rocket to make it fly in the air better,it worked pretty good but we should have put a cone at the top of the rocket so it would glide in the air better. </u></I></center>
      
      <center><p><b><I><u> October 26, today we tried to make a water filtration system using sand, tiny rocks, big rocks, and cotton. The layering worked best when you used cotton first to get all of the exteremly tiny bits of dirt out, then sand to filter the small ammounts of dirt, then used little rocks to filter the small chunks of dirt, and finally big rocks to filter out the big chunks of mulch and dirt. It was hard to create this system but the way me and Andres did it was by using two different bottles. The first bottle was to filter the bigger picese of dirt and then the second bottle was to filter all the micro pieces of dirt, it didn't work out the best but it somewhat worked. I think the problem was that we used too many layers so it was actually counter productive. </u></I></center>

     <center><p><b><I><u> November 2, We learned about how electricity works in Voltages, we use the greek letter Omega to tell the voltages. It's still confusing for me but I'm starting to understand it more, theres a minumum level of voltages that you use and a maximum because you don't want it to explode. We also learned about Breadboards and how they are used to power things like LED's. We also use transistors to limit the flow of the voltages so it's under our control. We use a tool called a multimeter to measure the ammount of voltages so it's easier to control. We are using tinkercad for our lab assignments and this was my first breadboard I made to power an LED. I used a multimeter, a transistor, an LED, and a battery to power this LED. Here is the picture of it. The second lab was much more challenging though, It was hard to figure it out without clear instructions. </u></I></center>

     <center><p><b><I><u> November 15, we went through lab 3 and 4 and there were some challenges along the way but it ended up working in the end. We managed to make the LED blink by using external code connected to the Arduino computer that made the LED blink. The Hardest part about lab 3 was figuring out how to use a single transistor to power the LED and make it work. The lab 4 was much easire to execute as the code was easier to implement and the hardware side of it was relatively easy. It as easy because we learned how to do it better after doing lab 3.  </u></I></center>
     <center><p><b><I><u> December 2, I read the Business slides from Andres and Aaron, it was about a ski invention we made that revolutionalizes ski's. It is a foldable ski that is easy to carry around, and it very sturdy, strong, and very durrable. It is very easy to move around and is nice. It has points in the middle of the skis that let's you retract and fold it. It is made with stronger material and will be much more useful than normal skis. </u></I></center>

  <center><p><b><I><u> January 12, me and Andres made oobleck with corn starch and water. All we had to do was mix the water with the oobleck and it turned into a solid - liquid material that was very interesting. When you used force on it became solid and grainy, but when you let go of it, it flowed through my fingers and turned into liquid. The more water I added, the more liquid it became. /u></I></center>
  
   <center><p><b><I><u> January 29, me and Andres are creating a mousetrap car, we started with a rough draft in CAD and it looked promising. We are using 4 CD's for the wheels and the mouse trap for the energy. One of the challanges of using a mousetrap car is making sure that it is light enough and that it doesn't steer in a different direction, we want it to just go straight forward and nowehre else. This might be challenging but if we lock the wheels in place it should be fine. The other challenges are other things such as using the enrgy effiecently and making sure all of it goes to use and doesn't become wasted.</u></I></center>
   
   <center><p><b><I><u> Febuary 14, me and Andres added a lot to our project. We finished the firt iteration and it turned out to be super good. We calculated that it would reach around 30 feet and it ended up reaching 22 which made us very happy. TheNext time we are going to use fishing line instead of string, and will keep the body length around the same as the first iteration. The biggest problem was the moustrap was only supported by tape, and because the stick was only glued to one side of the moustrap, it ripped the other side out of the actual moustrap, and becaues there was only tape holding it up,it felt down and became a mess. We fill fix all of this in the second iteration.</u></I></center>
   
   <center><p><b><I><u> Febuary 26, me and Andres finished the second iteration and it ended up working extremely well, we fixed some of the main problems we had last time such as: supporting the mouse trap on a cardboard plank instead of tape, supporting the other side of the moustrap so it doesn't rip off when the stick is pulled up, using fishing line instead of string, and more. This ended up going 41 feet which was much better then the first which was only 22.</u></I></center>
   
   
   <center><p><b><I><u> March 8, me and Andres finished our egg drop and it turned out really well. It survived all the tests and did an amazing job. We put the egg in a little carboard box that we made large enough for the egg to sit comfortable in there surrounded by cotton. We then taped the box shut and then attached two strings to the top which were both connected to a balloon, both baloons were covered by plastic bags to slow down the fall by collecting air. It did a great job and I am very happy with the result.</u></I></center>

      <center><p><b><I><u> April 3, Today we tested our boat and sadly it didn't go as planned. The water went into the sides of the cup and ended up sinking the cup. It was also hard to blow on the cup because there wasn't anything to catch the air. For our next boat, we wil make sure the water doesn't slip through the sides of the boat and we will make sure that there is a piece of paper to catch the wind.</u></I></center>
     
     <center><p><b><I><u> April 24. We had to makea boat to travel across the pool and back using a special rule set. Maximum 7cm hih, 14cm long, and 7cm wide. We need to make sure the boat has good buoyancy and can float without without water going into the cracks. We will make the boat using cardboard and are only allowed one roll of tape. We are planning to make two layers for the boat to make sure that it stays afloat and the water doesn't come through and sink the boat. Me and Andres will be in the boat which will be totalling around 255 lbs. </u></I></center>
     
     <center><p><b><I><u> May 17, we finished the boat and it has turned out really well. We executed our boat design very well with a lot of tape to spare. For the bottom of the boat, we used cardboard squigless to create a small gap between the bottom of the boat, and the second layer we added. This second layer will be very important for making sure the boat stays afloat and buoyant. We created paddles for the boat which aren't the biggest but they will work. Me and Andres both sat in the boat at the same time and we fit perfectly, the hard part that we have to think about is how to get in the boat properly when its in the pool. We also used the extra tape we had to add layers to any corner or area that water could come through to make sure that it is waterproof. </u></I></center>

     <center><p><b><I><u> May 30, we took the boat into the pool and it was a very interesting experience. We set the boat in the water and got in one at a time. A big problem that we should've fixed was taping the second layer of floor to the actual boat instead of just letting it sit there. This was important beacues the second layer partially came up when I got into the boat and it almost resulted in the boat flipping over before me and Andres could both get into the boat. We made it halfway across the pool when the back of the boat started sinking. There were some slight leaks in the back which caused the boat to start sinking. The paddles for the boat were also useless and we should've made the surfacearea bigger on them so we colud grab more water. Another problem that we didn't realize would cause a problem, was the sides of the boat being so high up that it was hard to reach your arm over and paddle the boat. Overall, it was a cool experience and if I were to make the boat again, I would know what I would need to fix.  </u></I></center>
